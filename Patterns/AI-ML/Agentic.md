# Agentic AI (Autonomous AI Agents)
** Coming soon....Draft/... **
## Summary
Agentic AI systems are autonomous agents that can understand goals, plan actions, execute them across various tools, evaluate results, and adapt their approach to accomplish complex tasks with minimal human supervision.

## Context
Use when applications require AI systems that can autonomously work on complex tasks that need multi-step reasoning, tool usage, planning, and persistence. Especially valuable when human-like problem-solving capabilities are needed.

## Problem
Traditional LLMs are limited to single-turn responses without memory, planning capabilities, or the ability to use tools autonomously. They cannot adapt to changing contexts or pursue multi-step goals with persistence.

## Solution
Create architectures that enable AI agents to plan, reason, use tools, maintain memory, and autonomously work toward a defined objective through multiple rounds of action and reflection.

## Components
### Core Agent
- **Large Language Model (LLM)** - The foundation model providing reasoning, planning, and natural language understanding capabilities
- **Planning Module** - Creates step-by-step plans to solve complex tasks and adapts when faced with obstacles
- **Memory System** - Stores conversation history, previous actions, and outcomes to maintain context
- **Reasoning Engine** - Evaluates information, makes decisions, and adapts strategies based on feedback

### Tools & Abilities
- **Tool Library** - Collection of specialized tools the agent can access (e.g., code execution, database access, web search, file operations)
- **Tool Selection Logic** - Determines which tool to use for specific subtasks
- **Tool Use Interface** - Standardized way for the agent to invoke tools and process their responses
- **Execution Environment** - Sandboxed environment where tools can be safely executed

### Orchestration
- **Orchestrator** - Manages the agent's workflow, task decomposition, and subtask delegation
- **Task Queue** - Prioritizes and manages tasks to be completed by the agent
- **Progress Monitoring** - Tracks task completion and detects failures or blockers
- **Human Feedback Integration** - Mechanism for incorporating human guidance when necessary

## Benefits
- Autonomous task completion without constant human intervention
- Ability to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning
- Adaptability to changing conditions or requirements during task execution
- Persistent effort toward goals despite obstacles
- Integration with various tools to extend capabilities beyond language generation

## Trade-offs
- Higher computational cost compared to simple LLM prompting
- Complex orchestration systems required for reliability
- More difficult to predict agent behavior compared to deterministic systems
- Security challenges when allowing autonomous tool usage
- May require fallback to human intervention in ambiguous situations
