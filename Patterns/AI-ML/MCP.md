# MCP (Model-Context-Protocol)

## Summary
MCP is an architectural pattern that defines communication standards between AI models, enabling reliable interaction with external tools, user interfaces, and other AI components.

## Context
Use when integrating multiple AI models or services that need to communicate with each other or with external tools in a standardized way. Especially valuable for building extensible AI systems that require predictable behavior.

## Problem
AI services often lack standardized communication protocols, making it difficult to integrate them with each other or with external tools. This limits interoperability and creates unpredictable behavior.

## Solution
Implement a structured protocol for AI model communications that defines context formatting, function calling standards, and error handling patterns.

## Workflow of MCP

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the system through the user interface.
2. **Controller**: The Controller captures the user input and processes it.
3. **Model**: The Controller communicates with the Model to perform operations such as data retrieval, processing, or model inference.
4. **Presenter**: The Presenter receives the processed data from the Model and formats it for display.
5. **User Interface Update**: The Presenter updates the user interface with the formatted data.

## Advantages of MCP

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain.
- **Testability**: The decoupled nature of the components allows for independent testing of the Model, Controller, and Presenter.
- **Scalability**: The pattern supports scaling individual components without affecting others.
- **Flexibility**: Changes to the user interface or business logic can be made independently.

## Use Case in AI/ML Systems

In AI/ML systems, the MCP pattern can be applied as follows:
- **Model**: Handles data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and inference.
- **Controller**: Manages user inputs, such as selecting datasets, configuring model parameters, or triggering training.
- **Presenter**: Displays model performance metrics, visualizations, and predictions to the user.

## Example

Below is a simple example of the MCP pattern in Python for an AI/ML system:

```python
# Model
class MLModel:
    def train(self, data):
        # Training logic
        pass

    def predict(self, input_data):
        # Prediction logic
        return "Prediction Result"

# Controller
class Controller:
    def __init__(self, model, presenter):
        self.model = model
        self.presenter = presenter

    def handle_user_input(self, input_data):
        result = self.model.predict(input_data)
        self.presenter.display_result(result)

# Presenter
class Presenter:
    def display_result(self, result):
        print(f"Prediction: {result}")

# Usage
model = MLModel()
presenter = Presenter()
controller = Controller(model, presenter)

# Simulate user input
user_input = "Sample Input"
controller.handle_user_input(user_input)
```

This example demonstrates how the MCP pattern can be used to structure an AI/ML application, ensuring clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

## Components
### Core Components
- **Model** - The AI model or service that processes inputs and generates outputs
- **Context** - Structured information package that provides all necessary data for the model to operate effectively
- **Protocol** - Standardized rules for communication between models, tools, and interfaces

### Protocol Elements
- **Function Schema** - Formal definition of available functions, parameters, and return types
- **Prompt Templating** - Standardized formatting for inputs to ensure consistent model behavior
- **Response Formatting** - Rules for structuring outputs to ensure parseable, usable responses
- **Error Handling** - Standard patterns for reporting and recovering from failures

### Integration Points
- **Tool Registry** - Central directory of available tools with their function schemas
- **Context Manager** - Maintains and updates the context throughout interactions
- **Interface Adapters** - Translates between internal MCP format and external APIs or UIs

## Benefits
- Improved interoperability between different AI models and services
- Predictable, reliable behavior from AI systems
- Easier integration of new tools and capabilities
- Standard error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Better developer experience through consistent protocols

## Trade-offs
- Initial overhead in implementing the protocol standards
- May add some latency due to protocol handling
- Requires agreement on standards across teams or organizations
- Can be challenging to retrofit existing systems to follow the protocol
